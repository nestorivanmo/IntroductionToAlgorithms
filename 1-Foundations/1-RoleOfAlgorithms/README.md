# The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## Algorithms

An *algorithm* is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values as output. An algorithm is said to be **correct** if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output. 

**Some problems solved by algorithms:**

- The Human Genome Project has made a great progress toward the goals of identifying all the 100,000 genes in human DNA. 
- Sites on the Internet are able to manage and manipulate this large volume of data. 
- Public-key cryptography and digital signatures. 

Some of the problems being solved by algorithms share the following traits: 

1. They have many candidate solutions, the overwhelming majority of which do not solve the problem at hand. Finding one that does, or one that is "best", can present quite a challenge. 
2. They have practical applications. 

**Data structures**

A *data structure* is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications. 

**Hard problems**

NP-complete problems are problems for which no efficient solution is known. 

1. No one has ever proven that an efficient algorithm for one cannot exist. 
2. If an efficient algorithm exists for any one of them, then efficient algorithms exist for all of them. 
3. Several NP-complete problems are simlilar but not identical to problems for which we do know of efficient algorithms. 

Concrete example: *Traveling-Salesman Problem*. 

## Algorithms as a technology

Computing time is a bounded resource, and so is space in memory. Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differn dramatically in their efficiency. These differences can be much more significant than differences due to hardware and software.
